# Bank-Customer-Churn-Analysis-Excel-Project-
This project explores customer churn in the banking sector using Excel. The goal is to identify the key drivers of churn and provide actionable insights that can help reduce customer attrition.  The analysis was done by combining Excelâ€™s advanced functions with statistical approaches to measure relationships, highlight trends.

# ðŸ“Š Dataset Summary

Total Records: 10,000 Customers
Key Columns: Customer ID, Age, Gender, Balance, Tenure, Credit Score, Estimated Salary, Exited(Churn)
Target Variable: Exited (Churn) (Yes/No)


# ðŸ§® Statistical Approaches**

1. Correlation Analysis
Used CORREL() to measure strength of relationships.
Example: Age â†” Churn correlation = 0.50 (suggesting churn is positively related to age).

2. Descriptive Statistics
Used AVERAGE for churned vs retained groups.
Provided comparative insights into balance and credit score distributions.

3. Regression & Trends
Applied trendlines in charts to visualize predictive patterns between customer attributes and churn.

4. Hypothesis-style Testing
Compared average balances between churned and active customers to check if financial engagement influences churn.
